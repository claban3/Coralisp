# Coralisp
This is my attempt at my very own lisp language. It is still being worked on, so I will add a nice clean readme once its all cleaned up. 
# Ive got some stuff working! 
I've got:
- grammar based acstract syntax tree to interpret lisp code
- a variable environment
- functions
- error handling

So much more to come you just wait! 
\* i'm talkin macros * i'm talking a control system * i'm talking complex types
